The ThingsBoard Mobile Application is an open-source [project](https://github.com/thingsboard/flutter_thingsboard_app) based on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
It allows you to build your own IoT mobile application **with minimum coding efforts**.

This documentation can help you set up and run your first IoT mobile app, learn how to customize the app and publish it to Google Play or App Store.
